# Bubble Sort Algorithm

This repository contains a Java implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm, along with a test suite and a benchmark.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git


2. **Install Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Make sure you have Java JDK installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official Oracle website: [Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)

3. **Install JUnit 5**: Download the JUnit 5 JAR files from the official website: [JUnit 5 Downloads](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#downloads)

## Running Tests in Visual Studio Code

To run the test suite in Visual Studio Code, you can use the Java Test Runner extension. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Java Test Runner Extension**: Install the "Java Test Runner" extension by Microsoft from the Visual Studio Code marketplace.

2. **Open the Project in Visual Studio Code**: Open the cloned repository folder in Visual Studio Code.

3. **Configure Test Runner**: Open the test class (`BubbleSortTest.java`) and click on the "Run Test" button next to each test method to execute individual test cases. You can also run all tests together by clicking on the "Run All Tests" button.

## Execution Instructions

### Bubble Sort Algorithm

To execute the Bubble Sort algorithm, follow these steps:

1. **Compile Java Files**: Compile the `BubbleSort.java` and `BubbleSortBenchmark.java` files using the `javac` command:
